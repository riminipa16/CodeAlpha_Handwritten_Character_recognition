Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR)This project implements a Deep Learning system to identify handwritten digits and alphabets using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is trained on the EMNIST (Balanced) dataset and is designed to run efficiently in a Google Colab environment.🎯 ObjectiveThe primary goal is to bridge the gap between human handwriting and digital text. The system takes a $28 \times 28$ grayscale image of a handwritten character and predicts its digital equivalent from 47 possible classes (0-9, A-Z, and select lowercase letters).🛠️ Approach & Tech StackDataset: EMNIST (Extended MNIST) via tensorflow-datasets.Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).Preprocessing: Image normalization, grayscale conversion, and bitwise inversion using OpenCV.Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.🏗️ Model ArchitectureThe model consists of a sequential pipeline optimized for spatial feature extraction:Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3): Extracts basic edges and shapes.MaxPooling2D: Reduces spatial dimensions to focus on important features.Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3): Extracts complex patterns.Flatten: Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.Dense (256 units): Fully connected layer for classification logic.Dropout (0.3): Regularization technique to prevent overfitting.Softmax Output: Provides probability scores for 47 classes.🚀 How to Run in Google ColabCell 1: Run the setup cell to download the EMNIST dataset and prepare the data pipeline.Cell 2: Execute the model definition to initialize the CNN layers.Cell 3: Start the training process (typically takes 2-3 minutes on Colab's CPU/GPU).Cell 4: Upload your own image (.jpg or .png). The script will automatically resize and predict the character.📈 Future ExtensionsCRNN Integration: Extend the project to full words by adding LSTM layers and CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss.Segmentation: Implement OpenCV contours to automatically split a sentence into individual character images for the CNN to process.📋 Dataset ClassesThe "Balanced" EMNIST dataset includes:Digits: 0-9Uppercase: A-ZLowercase: a, b, d, e, f, g, h, n, q, r, t (Letters that look distinct from their uppercase versions).
